Section 4.1.2  Equality

Just an amusing sentence I thought was noteworthy:
"Having two kinds of equality might seem strange. 
However, it's really just the type-token distinction, familiar from natural language, 
here showing up in a programming language."

But wait, is it REALLY isomorphic?  I mean, a programming language is a language too...

From Chapter 1
- A token is the technical name for a sequence of characters
- A word type is the form or spelling of the word independently of its specific occurrences in a text

So "type" is like "value", and type-equality is like "=="
And "token" is like "object", and token-equality is like "is"

Don't get confused!  Think of variables as just dummy labels for EITHER types or tokens, but themselves neither.
